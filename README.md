# iNaturalia

This is a Ruby wrapper on the [iNaturalist](https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/#!/Search/get_search) API. Code follow the spirit/approach of the Gem [serrano](https://github.com/sckott/serrano), and indeed much of the wrapping utility is copied 1:1 from that repo, thanks [@sckott](https://github.com/sckott).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'inaturalia'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install inaturalia

## Usage

---
### Search
Search places, projects, taxa, or users:
```ruby
Inaturalia.search(q: 'Quercus', sources: 'taxa') #  => MultiJson object
```
---

---
### Taxa
Search and fetch taxa with a comma-separted list of IDs:
```ruby
Inaturalia.taxa(id: '1,2') #  => MultiJson object
```
Search and fetch taxa:
```ruby
Inaturalia.taxa(q: 'Danaus plexippus', rank: 'species') #  => MultiJson object
```
Fetch taxa ordered by greatest observations count:
```ruby
Inaturalia.taxa(rank: 'species', order: 'desc', order_by: 'observations_count') #  => MultiJson object
```
---

---
### Taxa autocomplete
Get suggested taxa names for a query Sinapis at ranks genus,species,subspecies with a limit of 5 suggestions:
```ruby
Inaturalia.taxa_autocomplete(q: 'Sinapis', rank: 'genus,species,subspecies', per_page: 5) #  => MultiJson object
```
Include all names for each suggested taxon:
```ruby
Inaturalia.taxa_autocomplete(q: 'Sinapis', rank: 'genus,species,subspecies', per_page: 5, all_names: true) #  => MultiJson object
```
Get common names by the language at preferred_place_id which adds a preferred_common_name key (use Inaturalia.places_autocomplete to lookup place_id's):
```ruby
Inaturalia.taxa_autocomplete(q: 'Danaus plexippus', preferred_place_id: 6903, rank: 'species') #  => MultiJson object
```
